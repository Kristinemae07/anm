          <p>In the Clover Kingdom, the orphans Asta (an outgoing, competitive boy) and Yuno (a quiet boy with an affinity for magic) want to become the next Wizard King, the most powerful wizard in the kingdom. One day, Asta and Yuno attend a magic ceremony to each receive a Grimoire suited to their abilities. Although each grimoire has a picture of a standard three-leaf clover on the cover (symbolising integrity, hope and love), Yuno receives an extremely-rare four-leaf-clover grimoire (symbolizing good luck), while Asta is embarrassed when he does not receive a grimoire. Yuno is attacked by a disgraced former magic knight intent on stealing the Four-leaf clover grimoire. Asta is badly beaten by the thief, who ridicules him for having zero magic potential. Asta's determination to win and Yuno's words of friendship summons a damaged black grimoire with a legendary five-leaf clover, which supposedly symbolizes the Devil.</p>

                  <p>In a flashback, a young Asta spends most of his time trying to propose to Sister Lily. He and Yuno are inspired by tales of the first Wizard King, and Asta says that he will become Wizard King some day. Yuno is asked to deliver an important letter to the chief of the next village, and is attacked and beaten on his way home by a thief who takes the necklace he was found holding when he was a baby. Yuno is too scared to fight back with his magic. Although he is seriously injured in his fight with the thief, Asta gets the necklace back when the thief becomes bored. Yuno wants to become as brave as Asta is, and announces that he is Asta's rival and will become the Wizard King before Asta does. In the present, Asta uses his black grimoire to summon a giant black sword and effortlessly defeats the thief. Asta and Yuno reaffirm their promise to remain friendly rivals until one of them becomes the Wizard King.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Asta and Yuno train relentlessly for the Magic Knight Selection exam, hoping to become a member of the Magic Knight squads, nine squads of knights who use magic for combat under the command of the Wizard King to defend the Clover Kingdom. Asta and Yuno's rivalry reaches a new height of childish competitiveness. Father Orgi and Sister Lily host a going-away party, congratulating Yuno on his expected future success and subtly reminding Asta that when he fails he can always return home. Nash, an orphan, tells Asta that if he becomes a Magic Knight it might mean that everyone's dreams can come true – even those of commoners and orphans. Asta and Yuno leave for the capital city – a journey of several days on foot – continuing to train as they travel and growing far stronger, although Yuno still outperforms Asta with magic (accomplishing tasks for which Asta must use strength and skill). They arrive at the capital city and the Magic Knight exam, where success involves proving themselves more powerful than the other Magic Knight candidates.</p>

                 <p>I would imagine that most of the negative reviews on here didn't make it too far into the series. I have to admit, for the first few episodes I found Asta's screaming a little overbearing. However with that being said, I am very glad I continued to give the show a chance, as I have found that either his yelling to calm down, or the greatness of the rest of the show has outbalanced it for me. Either way I have found the show to be very enjoyable and worth a watch. -Give it a chance</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>It took me a while to like this show; at first it was my last result for entertainment when nothing else was on. But eventually I got hooked. It seems like a derivative cookie-cutter anime, but it eventually takes the time to do things quite differently compared to other shows like it. This makes it feel like a fresh new, addictive series. Great for binge watching! -Slow Burn, but Good Show</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>A promising show that has pontential to grow into a overall masterpiece I recommend you give it a watch. -Decent</p>
